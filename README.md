# BackupYTPlaylists
Script to backup playlists since some videos might get deleted.

Usage:

python manualSave.py <url_of_playlist>

It will output a JSON with the information of all tracks (and possible candidates for those that are gone)

The actual idea is to have it running in the "cloud" so it backups regularly and sends you the result.
